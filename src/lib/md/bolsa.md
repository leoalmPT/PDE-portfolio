I started working under a research grant at the University of Aveiro and Instituto de Telecomunicações as part of the **Agenda Mobilizadora para a Inovação Empresarial** in collaboration with **NEXUS – Pacto de Inovação – Transição Verde e Digital para Transportes, Logística e Mobilidade**. My research focuses on the application of **Machine Learning (ML) in SmartPort environments**, particularly at the Port of Sines.

The research aims to develop an **efficient MLOps framework** to manage ML functions in heterogeneous devices, focusing on resource mapping and cost estimation for optimized task allocation within the intelligence pipeline. This is particularly relevant for applications in **SmartPorts** and will involve designing and implementing a **communication layer** that supports dynamic participation and secure updates within Federated Learning environments.

My master’s thesis shares significant overlap with the work carried out in this grant. Both explore **Federated Learning (FL)**, focusing on improving communication layers to handle dynamic network conditions and the challenges posed by distributed devices. Through my thesis, I aim to contribute to a resilient FL framework adaptable to various network environments, which aligns with the objectives of the research grant.

On 27 June 2024, I and Pedro Rodrigues traveled to Porto to present our paper, *"Privacy-Preserving Defense: Intrusion Detection in IoT using Federated Learning,"* at the IEEE Melecon 2024 conference. The paper was published in the conference proceedings and is available on IEEE Xplore.

In this study, we investigated the effectiveness of Federated Learning (FL) for training Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) models while maintaining data privacy in IoT environments. We utilized three cutting-edge datasets to assess FL-based training methods with different worker counts. Our findings show that FL-based training delivers performance comparable to traditional single training methods across various metrics, while also preserving data privacy.

On a personal note, I thoroughly enjoyed the conference. I had the chance to meet new people and learn about the latest advancements in the field. Overall, it was a fantastic experience, and I look forward to attending more conferences in the future.

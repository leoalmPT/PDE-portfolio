Aveiro Tech Week is a week-long event in Aveiro, Portugal, organized by the Município de Aveiro to bring together the local tech community. It features talks, workshops, and game events, aiming to showcase local talent and foster collaboration among tech enthusiasts.

<br>

A key event is the hackathon, where participants tackle real-world challenges. This year, local companies such as Altice Labs, Bosch, Sky, and the Instituto de Telecomunicações (IT) proposed challenges.

<br>

My team chose Altice Labs' challenge, "MEDIA DIVE - New Interaction Forms on TV with Enriched Content." We developed a system that identifies users’ profiles and creates personalized TV experiences. Instead of traditional show lists, our system generates engaging summaries using enriched metadata from the MEDIA DIVE API and large language models (LLMs) for transcript-based summaries.

We won the challenge, earning a 5000€ prize.

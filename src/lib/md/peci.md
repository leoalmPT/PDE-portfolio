I started assisting in the supervision of a final project for the **LECI** Bachelor’s degree as part of the **PECI** subject. The project is titled **"Federated Learning Management"** and is supervised by **Mário Antunes** and co-supervised by **Rafael Teixeira**.

<br>

The project aims to develop a robust management tool to simplify and optimize the federated learning process, addressing the complexities of coordinating multiple devices, enhancing training, and ensuring data privacy and security.

<br>

The project begins with an analysis of the existing Federated Learning platform to identify limitations in API support and monitoring tools. Next, the team will define the requirements for necessary APIs and implement them to enhance training management and monitoring capabilities. Following this, a web-based management framework will be developed to streamline the federated learning process and track progress. The solution will be validated through a realistic deployment of federated learning nodes. Finally, comprehensive documentation will be created to guide users in utilizing the framework and interpreting the results.

<br>

The base code for the project is an adaptation of the that I developed for my master's thesis.
